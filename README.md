How to set up local dev environment to get files locally on any machine and add / make changes 

Step 1: <br>
Clone the project using the following command <br>
---> `git clone <copied .git extension link>`

Step 2: <br>
---> Verify the files are on your machine in your desired directory 

Step 3: <br>
You need all the node packages and API's that I incorporated, to do this: <br>
  cd into the into the project  <br>
--->  `cd fullscan/` <br> <br>
  Install the node packages using: <br>
--->  `npm i` OR `npm install` 
  <br>
  Or you can install all the packages individually to ensure no fatal errors occur in the set up process<br> <br>
  ---> `npm i express` <br>
  ---> `npm i bodyParser` <br>
  ---> `npm i ejs` <br>
  ---> `npm i mongoose` <br>
  ---> `npm i ejs` <br>
<br>
Step 4: <br>
Once all packages are installed you need to fire up the local server to be able to view the web document
You can do this however you see fit but I like to use nodemon as a background app.js refresher
<br> <br>
Once the server is up and running. Go to `localhost:3000`<br>
If you can see the webpage, great job, you can now make changes to the code and see those changes locally
